(experience of a 5 year experienced in empire)

Morale lost
- Someone from house went down
- More than half the lance disappear
- Watching allies die and "I can't help them"
- Surprise attack out of nowhere
- Something "new" coming to face you

Morale gain
- Completion of objective
- Coming to the aid (successfully) of allies
- Successful battlefield manoeuvre

Things to boost skill
- Knowing your enemy and their capability
- Know the tactics against a given enemy
- applies to both 1v1 knowledge and group tactics
- applies to preparation as well
- Be very aware of surroundings

Mistakes
- Misread the enemy by thinking they are a mage, which is hold weapons close but they ere a fighter so that was weapons out.
- Took time and allowed the enemy time to out-manoeuvre you.
- Confusing command and lack of clarity is demoralising. Soldiers lose faith in commander.

battle-style
- Human nature, no matter what, stops people running into danger
- Random charge attacks will happen just to be bored, other times it's because SOMEONE needs to go first.
- cohesion is generally pretty tight with medium experience up until near the end of battle because retreating is untrained behaviour.
- Banner moved to pretty regularly. Every 10 minutes or so. Leadership good, no leadership not so often. Healers and near-combat do much.
- Banner going down is very... situationally handled. Something would have gone wrong and there's sometimes a panic rush to the banner that can leave holes in a shield wall.

Technical stuff
- Hero points used as called unless enemy didn't take it.-
